        Joshua Davis is often referred to as a legend in the digital art space.
        His history in pushing the boundaries of generative, programmatic art is
        unquestionable. His code symphonies are operatic. The codebase is one of
        his masterpieces that has yielded a body of artwork that is vital,
        arresting and gorgeous. The artwork is a glorious fusion of creativity,
        both human and machine. As a painter, turned programmer, computation
        became a way to amplify his vision. Animation and interaction presented
        yet another frontier.
